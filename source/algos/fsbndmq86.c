 * This is an implementation of the Forward Semplified BNDM algorithm using
 * q-grams in Hannu Peltola and Jorma Tarhio Variations of Forward-SBNDM
 * Proceedings of the Prague Stringology Conference 2011, pp.3--14, Czech
 * Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic, (2008). Q is the dimension of
 * q-grams F is the number of forward characters
 *
 * Note: Broken!
 * Constraints: requires m>=8
