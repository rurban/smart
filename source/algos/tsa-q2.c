/* Note: Does not support OUTPUT with the found pos yet, only the count.
   Note: Needed 4 fixes
  1. Stack buffer overflow: HS() hash could reach 765 for high-byte
     characters, indexing B[512] out of bounds on any binary/random
     input.
  2. Coverage gap: stride i += m left Q-1 text positions
     between anchors unexamined for any Q > 1 (only worked by
     coincidence for the Q=1 sibling tsa.c, where window width equals
     stride).
  3. Killed occurrence bit: the forward mask's exponent was
     off by Q-1, always discarding the bit that signals a match
     starting at the anchor's leftmost position (s=0, m, 2m, ...).
  4. Design gap for m==Q: no verification loop runs at all in that
     case, so a match would depend purely on lossy-hash luck — routed
     to the exact search_small fallback instead.
  Constraints: requires m>=2, m<=64. requires T[n + 1] to be accessable.
