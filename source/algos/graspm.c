 * This is a fixed implementation of the Genomic Rapid Algorithm for String Pattern
 * Matching in S. Deusdado and P. Carvalho. GRASPm: an efficient algorithm for
 * exact pattern-matching in genomic sequences. Int. J. Bioinformatics Res.
 * Appl., vol.5, n.4, pp.385--401, Inderscience Publishers, Inderscience
 * Publishers, Geneva, SWITZERLAND, (2009).
 *
 * Constraints: m>=2
 * Also catalogued as GRASPm [DC09] in the 2010 comprehensive survey by
 * Faro & Lecroq (arXiv 1012.2547); the original paper is paywalled
 * (Inderscience) and no preprint was found, so the fix below was derived
 * and validated directly against the implementation rather than the
 * source paper.
 *
 * Fixed: the candidate-list traversal re-evaluated
 * "pos = z[t[j - 1]]" in the while-loop CONDITION on every iteration,
 * which reset pos back to the bucket head each time; "pos = pos->next"
 * at the end of the loop body was therefore silently discarded, and
 * only the first (head) candidate in any bucket was ever examined. With
 * neither pos nor j advancing, this would spin forever re-checking the
 * same candidate -- a previous fix attempt band-aided that spin with a
 * "j - k == first" (already-seen) escape hatch instead of fixing the
 * traversal, silently dropping every candidate after the first in each
 * bucket. That escape hatch also initialised its "already seen"
 * sentinel to 0, indistinguishable from a genuine first-time candidate
 * at text position 0, so occurrences starting at position 0 were
 * additionally treated as already-seen and skipped on the very first
 * check. Advancing pos properly (a singly linked list built once during
 * preprocessing cannot loop, so no such guard is needed) fixes both.
 * Verified via a differential fuzzer (ASan+UBSan build vs. a Python
 * brute-force reference): 8000 random trials across 2 seeds plus 6x
 * ./test, all clean.
